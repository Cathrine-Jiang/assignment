# README
This is a repo for an assignment for course Getting and Cleaning Data.

This assignment is to get data, subset it, extract the target part and clean it.

You will find an R script and a code book.
 
In the codebook, you can find how I clean up the data and the description for all the variables.

You don't need to download the data seperately, just run the script and it will download, unzip, and clean data for you.

If you already download the data, it will be alright. You can skip the download and unzip part of R script as you already did it by yourself.

The output will be the average of each mean and standard deviation measurements for each volunteer of each activities.

To read the result, simply use read.table() function. And be careful it has the column names.
